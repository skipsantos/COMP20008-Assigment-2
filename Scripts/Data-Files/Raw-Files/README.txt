Merging Datasets Using Foreign Keys---------------------------------------------------To merge these datasets, you can use the common field `ISBN` in BX-Books.csv and BX-Ratings.csv. Similarly, `User-ID` can be used as a foreign key to merge BX-Ratings.csv and BX-Users.csv.Here's a sample Python code to merge the datasets using pandas:```python# Merge ratings with booksmerged_data = pd.merge(ratings, books, on='ISBN', how='inner')# Merge merged_data with usersmerged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, users, on='User-ID', how='inner')```Subsampling from Large Datasets----------------------------------------------Working with large datasets can be computationally intensive. If you encounter performance issues, you can subsample the datasets to work with smaller portions. Here's a way to sensibly subsample the datasets:```python# Subsample from bookssubsample_books = books.sample(n=1000, random_state=42)# Get sampled ISBNssampled_isbns = subsample_books['ISBN']# Subsample from ratings based on sampled ISBNssubsample_ratings = ratings[ratings['ISBN'].isin(sampled_isbns)]# Get sampled User-IDs from subsample_ratingssampled_user_ids = subsample_ratings['User-ID']# Subsample from users based on sampled User-IDssubsample_users = users[users['User-ID'].isin(sampled_user_ids)]```Users can adjust the sample sizes according to their computational resources and analysis requirements.
